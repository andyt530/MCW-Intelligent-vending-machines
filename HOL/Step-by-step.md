## Exercise 1: Create Dynamic Pricing Model

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a machine learning model that predicts the purchase price for an item sold by the vending machine, provided the demographics of the customer and the item. You will then operationalize this model by exposing it as a web service hosted in Azure Machine Learning, and test it out.

### Task 1: Create a model locally

1. On your Lab VM, locate the starter project solution file, `VendingMachines.sln`, in the C:\\VendingMachines\\HOL\starter-project folder and double-click it to open it with Visual Studio 2017.

2. If prompted, select Visual Studio 2017 from the Microsoft Visual Studio Version Selector.

    ![Visual Studio 2017 in selected in the Microsoft Visual Studio Version Selector.](./media/visual-studio-version-selector.png "Microsoft Visual Studio Version Selector")

3. Sign in to Visual Studio or create an account, if prompted.

4. If the Security Warning for Simulator window appears, uncheck **Ask me for every project in this solution**, and select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of the Security warning for Simulator window. The checkbox is cleared for "Ask me for every project in this solution."](./media/visual-studio-security-warning.png "Security warning for Simulator")

    > Note: If you attempt to build the solution at this point, you will see many build errors. This is intentional. You will correct these in the exercises that follow.

5. Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the **PricingModel** project and open the file `TrainModel.R` by double-clicking on the file in the Solution Explorer.

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expanded to: Solution VendingMachines\\PricingModel\\TrainModel.R.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-trainmodel.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

6. Read the script. The top portion, entitled Create Sample Data, has been provided for you and you will generate the sample data you will use to train your model.

7. Highlight all the text between the "Create Sample Data" and "END Create Sample Data" comments.

8. Right-click the selected text and select **Execute In Interactive**.

    ![Screenshot of the Train Model tab, with Execute In Interactive highlighted on the sub-menu.](./media/visual-studio-execute-in-interactive.png "Train Model tab")

9. You should see it execute in the R Interactive Window, ending with a summary of the created data.

    ![Screenshot of the R Interactive - Microsoft R Client window. ](./media/visual-studio-r-interactive-sample-data.png "R Interactive - Microsoft R Client window")

10. From the R Tools menu, select Windows, then select Variable Explorer.

    ![Screenshot of the R tools menu, with Windows / Variable Explorer selected.](./media/visual-studio-r-tools-menu-variable-explorer.png "R tools menu")

11. Expand the variable **sampleData**, and explore the structure of the created data.

    ![Screenshot of the Variable Explorer, with sampleData selected.](./media/visual-studio-r-tools-variable-explorer.png "Variable Explorer")

12. Now save this sampleData to a file by replacing `TODO 1` in the `TrainModel.R` script with the following code:

    ```r
    # TODO: 1. Export the sample data to a file
    save(sampleData, file = "sampleData.RData")
    ```

13. Highlight the **save line**, and select **Execute In Interactive**.

14. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location of the **PricingModel** (C:\\VendingMachines\\HOL\\starter-project\\PricingModel) project on disk. You should see the file `sampleData.RData` on disk.

    ![Screenshot of File Explorer, with sampleData.RData selected, and the pop-up listing the Type (R Workspace), Size (2.85 KB), and Data/time modified.](./media/file-explorer-sampledata-rdata.png "File Explorer, sampleData.RData")

15. Back in the `TrainModel.R` file in Visual Studio, replace `TODO 2` with the following code that builds the model using a Linear Regression.

    ```r
    # TODO: 2. Build a linear regression model to predict purchase price given age, gender and # productSelect
    pricingModel <- rxLinMod(purchasePrice ~ age + gender + productSelected, data = sampleData)
    ```

16. Save that trained model to disk by replacing `TODO 3` with:

    ```r
    # TODO: 3. Export the trained model to a file named pricingModel.rda
    save(pricingModel, file = "pricingModel.RData")
    ```

17. Finally, save the first row of the sample data to a file so you can re-use the structure later when operationalizing the model. Replace `TODO 4` with:

    ```r
    # TODO: 4. Save one example of the sample data to serve as an input template, to a file
    # called inputExample.rda
    inputExample <- sampleData[1,]
    save(inputExample, file = "inputExample.RData")
    ```

18. Save your changes to `TrainModel.R`.

19. Highlight TODO items 2 through 4 and execute them in interactive.

20. In the same folder as your script, you should now have the files `sampleData.RData`, `pricingModel.RData`, and `inputExample.RData`.

    ![Screenshot of File Explorer, with the previously mentioned files highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-r-output-data-files.png "File Explorer")

### Task 2: Try a prediction locally

1. Within Visual Studio, open `PredictUsingModel.r` under the Pricing Model project in Solution Explorer.

2. Replace `TODO 1` with the following:

    ```r
    # TODO: 1. Prepare the input to use for prediction
    inputExample[1,]$age <- 30
    inputExample[1,]$gender <- "F"
    inputExample[1,]$productSelected <- "coconut water"
    ```

3. Replace `TODO 2` with the following:

    ```r
    # TODO: 2. Execute the prediction
    prediction <- rxPredict(pricingModel, data = inputExample)
    ```

4. Highlight all the script in the file and execute it in interactive.

5. Using Variable Explorer, expand the prediction variable and observe the price the model suggested to use for purchasing the coconut water for input of a 30-year-old female.

    ![Screenshot of Variable Explorer, prediction table. The purchasePrice_Prec is 0.949.](./media/visual-studio-r-prediction.png "Variable Explorer")

### Task 3: Create the model in R Server on HDInsight

1. On your Lab VM, open a Git Bash shell from the start menu.

2. At the command prompt, you will enter the following command to create the SSH connection:

    ```bash
    ssh remoteuser@<clustername>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

    > Replace \<clustername\> with the name of your HDInsight cluster, which you can obtain from the Overview blade of your HDInsight cluster in the Azure portal.

    ![Screenshot of the HDInsight cluster blade for vendingmachineslab. Overview is selected in the left pane, and in the right pane, on the menu bar, Secure Shell (SSH) is highlighted.](./media/hdinsight-menu-ssh.png "HDInsight cluster blade")

    ![Screenshot of Connect to cluster. Ssh.azurehdinsight.net is highlighted in the Hostname field, with the endpoint highlighted below.](./media/hdinsight-connect-to-cluster-with-ssh.png "Connect to cluster section")

3. If prompted to continue connecting, enter yes.

4. Enter the password for **remoteuser** (Password: Password.1!!).

    ![Screenshot of the Git Bash window, with three command lines highlighted. The first is the remoteuser@clustername information. The second line is a prompt asking whether you want to continue connecting. The third is the remoteuser cluster name request for password.](./media/git-bash-ssh-to-hdinsight-cluster.png "Git Bash window")

5. At the command prompt, type **R** to load the R shell (be sure to use a capital letter "R").

6. Run the following command to create a spark context for R:

    ```r
    sparkCluster <- RxSpark()
    rxSetComputeContext(sparkCluster)
    ```

7. In Visual Studio, open `TrainModel.r`, and copy the entire script.

8. Paste the script in the R shell, and press ENTER. (You may need to press ENTER a few times until you get to the last line of the script.)

9. When the script has finished executing, type the following:

    ```r
    dir()
    ```

10. You should see it list the three files created by the script, as follows:

    ![Screenshot of the results of running the TrainModel.R script in R shell, listing the following three files: inputExample.RData, pricingModel.RData, and sampleData.RData.](./media/git-bash-trainmodel-r-result.png "Results of TrainModel.R script in R shell")

11. Now, copy those files from local storage to Blob storage by using the Hadoop File System. First, create a folder in which to store your output.

    ```r
    modelExportDir <- "/models"
    rxHadoopMakeDir(modelExportDir)
    ```

12. List the contents of the root ("/") directory, and confirm your "**/models**" folder has been created. Notice that the list you are looking at is folders directly underneath the container in Azure Storage that was created with your cluster.

    ```r
    rxHadoopListFiles("/")
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Git Bash R shell window, with the previously mentioned information displaying, and the /models folder information highlighted.](./media/git-bash-r-shell-file-list.png "Git Bash R Shell")

13. Copy the `pricingModel.RData` from the local directory to the **/models** folder in HDFS by running the following command:

    ```r
    rxHadoopCopyFromLocal("pricingModel.RData", modelExportDir)
    ```

14. Repeat the previous step for `inputExample.RData` and `sampleData.RData`.

15. Run the following command to verify the three files now exist in HDFS (and Blob storage), under /models.

    ```r
    rxHadoopListFiles("/models")
    ```

16. The output should look similar to the following:

    ![Screenshot of the Git Bash R Shell window with output verifying that the three files exist in HDFS.](./media/git-bash-r-shell-models-file-list.png "Git Bash R Shell")

17. Using Visual Studio, Cloud Explorer, navigate to the storage account for your HDInsight cluster, expand:

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio, Cloud Explorer expanded as: labstorageSUFFIX\\Blob Containers\\vendingmachinescluster.](./media/visual-studio-cloud-explorer-lab-storage-container.png "Cloud Explorer storage container")

18. Right-click the storage container, and select **Open.**

19. In the editor that appears, double-click the models folder, and verify you see your files.

    ![Cloud Explorer file explorer displaying files listed under models/; three files display: inputExampleRData, pricingModelRData, and sampleDataRData.](./media/visual-studio-cloud-explorer-models-folder.png "Cloud Explorer Files")

20. Right-click `inputExample.RData` and select Save As... and choose the directory for your `PricingModel` project, overwriting files if prompted.

21. Repeat the previous step for `pricingModel.RData` and `sampleData.RData`.

22. You have now used R Server on HDInsight to train a model that you can then upload to R Server Operationalization to expose it as a web service.

### Task 4: Create predictive service in R Server Operationalization

After training a model, you want to operationalize the model so that it becomes available for integration by developers. One way to operationalize a trained model is to take the model you trained in HDInsight, and then to expose that as a predictive web service. In this task, you take a version of the scripts you have been running locally and in HDInsight and migrate them to run in the VM that is running R.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the Microsoft Machine Learning Server Virtual Machine, named LabMLServer, you provisioned with the ARM template.

2. On top of the Overview blade, select Connect, then copy the SSH command.

    ![The Connect dialog for the Microsoft Machine Learning Server is displayed, and the SSH command has been copied.](./media/machine-learning-server-ssh-command-copied.png "SSH Command copied")

3. Using a new Git Bash window on your Lab VM, SSH into your Microsoft Machine Learning Server VM by pasting the SSH command you copied above at the command prompt. For example:
    **ssh radmin@[your-server-ip]**

4. When prompted if you want to continue connecting, enter yes.

5. Enter your password, **Password.1!!**

6. At the prompt, after successfully logging in, you will need to complete a few tasks to configure and operationalize the environment.

7. Run the following command to act as root:

    ```bash
    sudo -i
    ```

8. Now that you are acting as root run the following command to:

    ```bash
    az ml admin node setup --onebox --admin-password Password.1!! --confirm-password Password.1!!
    ```
    > If the above command gives you issues, you can also try running the following, and then enter the password when prompted:

    ```bash
    az ml admin node setup --onebox
    ```

    ![Command to setup ML server to host a webservice has been completed. the port 12800 is highlighted.](./media/git-bash-setup-ml-web-service.png "Web Service Listening")

9. In Visual Studio, open the `App.config` for the Simulator project. This can be done by expanding the Simulator project in the Solution Explorer, and double-clicking on `App.config` under the **Simulator** project.

    ![The Visual Studio Solution Explorer has Simulator highlighted and expanded, and under it, App.config highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-simulator-app-config.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

10. Locate the `appSetting` `rServiceBaseAddress` and enter **<http://[your-server-public-ip]:12800>** for the value. (For example: <http://52.168.132.221:12800>). Your server IP address is the same IP address you used for the SSH connection in Step 3 of this task, above.

11. Locate **rServicePassword** in the appSettings section and update its value with the password you defined when you configured your R server for Operationalization (step 11 above), **Password.1!!**

    ![The App.config file for the project is open with the AppSettings for three keys shown. These include the URL to the server, user name and password.](./media/visual-studio-app-config-appsettings.png "App.config appSettings section")

12. Save `App.config`.

13. Open `PredictPricingService.r` within the **PricingModel** project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.

    ![The Visual Studio Solution Explorer has PricingModel expanded, and under it, PredictPricingService.r highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-pricing-model-predict-pricing-service.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

14. Find `TODO 1`, and replace with the following code block:

    ```r
    # TODO: 1. Load packages needed for operationalization
    usePackage <- function(p) {
    if (!is.element(p, installed.packages()[, 1]))
    install.packages(p, dep = TRUE)
    library(p, character.only = TRUE)
    }
    usePackage("curl")
    usePackage("ggplot2")
    usePackage("mrsdeploy")
    usePackage("RevoScaleR")
    ```

15. Find `TODO 2`, and replace with the following code block to remotely connect to the R Server Operationalization service:

    ```r
    # TODO: 2. Configure remote login
    remoteLogin(
    deployr_endpoint = "http://<your-server-ip>:12800",
    username = "admin",
    password = "<your-admin-password>"
    )
    pause()
    ```

    > **Note:** Make sure to replace **\<your-server-ip\>** with the IP address with your VM's IP address, and enter the password you specified when you configured your R server for Operationalization (Password.1!!) in place of **\<your-admin-password\>**. The `TODO 2` section should looking something like the following screen shot.

    ![Screenshot of the TODO 2 section, with the IP address and password highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-predict-pricing-service-todo-2.png "TODO 2 section")

16. Highlight all the code in `PredictPricingService.r`, right-click and then **execute in interactive**. The last output status in the R Interactive window should be "Published service".

17. Find `TODO 3` and replace with the following code block to consume the API as a test:

    ```r
    # TODO: 3. Consume the API as a test
    services <- listServices("apiPredictPurchasePrice")
    serviceName <- services[[1]]
    api <- getService(serviceName$name, serviceName$version)
    result <- api$apiPredictPurchasePrice(30, "F", "coconut water")
    print("Result: ")
    print(result$output("answer"))
    result
    ```

18. Find `TODO 4` and replace with the following code block to generate and save the Swagger JSON file for the API:

    ```r
    # TODO: 4. Generate the Swagger JSON file for the API
    swagger <- api$swagger()
    cat(swagger, file = "swagger.json", append = FALSE)
    ```

19. Highlight just the `TODO 3` and `TODO 4` code blocks you added and execute in interactive.

20. When you scroll up through the R Interactive window results, you should see an output with your prediction like the following:

    ```r
    $success
    [1] TRUE

    $errorMessage
    [1] ""

    $outputParameters
    $outputParameters$purchasePrice
    [1] 0.9348741
    ```

21. Also open the `swagger.json` file in your PricingModel project directory to view its contents. This file can be used within the `swagger.io` online editor to generate client code to connect to your service. We have already done this for you within the included IO.Swagger project.

## Exercise 2: Implement dynamic pricing

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement the code that performs dynamic pricing, capitalizing on the Face API to acquire demographics, and your deployed pricing model to suggest the price based on those demographics. You will then run the vending machine simulator and see the dynamic pricing in action.

### Task 1: Implement photo uploads to Azure Storage

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the Simulator project and then `MainWindow.xaml` and then open `MainWindow.xaml.cs`.

    ![Visual Studio Solution Explorer is expanded as: Simulator\\MainWindow.xaml\\MainWindow.xaml.cs.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-simulator-mainwindowxaml-cs.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2. Scroll down to the method `UpdateDynamicPricing`.

    ![The UpdateDynamicPrice function is high-lighted in Visual Studio.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-simulator-mainwindowxaml-updatedynamicprice.png "UpdateDynamicPrice function")

3. Replace `TODO 1` with the following:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 1. Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(_storageConnectionString);
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("photos");
    ```

4. Replace `TODO 2` with the following:
    ```csharp
    // TODO 2. Retrieve reference to a blob named with the value of fileName.
    string blobName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + System.IO.Path.GetExtension(filename);
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(blobName);
    ```

5. Replace `TODO 3` with the following:
    ```csharp
    // TODO 3. Create or overwrite the blob with contents from a local file.
    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(filename))
    {
        blockBlob.UploadFromStream(fileStream);
    }
    ```

6. Save `MainWindow.xaml.cs`.

### Task 2: Provision Cognitive Services Face API

To provision access to the Face API (which provides demographic information about photos of human subjects), you will need to provision a Cognitive Services account.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource**, enter "face" into the Search the Marketplace box, select **Face** from the results, and select **Create**.

    ![+Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, "face" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box, and Face is highlighted in the results.](./media/create-resource-cognitive-services-face-api.png "Create Face API")

2. On the Create Face API blade:

    * **Name**: Enter a name, such as vendingfaceapi

    * **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab

    * **Location**: Select the location you are using for this hands-on lab

    * **Pricing tier**: Select F0

    * **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group

        ![The Face API Create blade is displayed, and the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](./media/cognitive-services-face-api-create.png "Create Face API")

    * Select **Create**

3. When the Face API finishes provisioning, browse to the Cognitive Services Face API by clicking on Go to resource in the Deployment succeeded notification.

    ![Screenshot of the Deployment succeeded message, with the Go to resource button highlighted.](./media/cognitive-services-face-api-deployment-succeeded.png "Deployment succeeded message")

4. On top of the Cognitive Services overview blade, click the Copy button to the right of the Endpoint. Paste this value into a text editor, such as Notepad, for later use.

    ![Screenshot of the Cognitive Services overview blade, Essentials section. The Endpoint url is highlighted, and a callout points to the "Click to Copy" button.](./media/azure-portal-cognitive-services-overview-endpoint.png "Cognitive Services overview blade, Essentials section")

5. In the Cognitive Services blade, select on Keys under the Resource Management heading.

    ![Screenshot of the Keys button.](./media/azure-portal-cognitive-services-keys.png "Keys button")

6. Click the Copy button next to the value for Key 1. Paste this value into a text editor, such as Notepad, for later use.

    ![The Azure portal is shown with Key copied for the API.](./media/azure-portal-cognitive-services-keys-key1.png "Copy Face API Keys")

### Task 3: Invoke Face API

1. Continuing with `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, scroll down to `GetBlobSasUri`. This method will create a Shared Access Signature URI that the Face API can use to securely access the image in blob storage.

    ![The GetBlobSasUri method is high-lighted in Visual Studio](./media/visual-studio-mainwindowxaml-getblobsasuri.png "GetBlobSasUri method")

2. Replace `TODO 4` with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 4. Create a Read blob and Write blob Shared Access Policy that is effective 5 minutes ago and for 2 hours into the future
    SharedAccessBlobPolicy sasConstraints = new SharedAccessBlobPolicy();
    sasConstraints.SharedAccessStartTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5);
    sasConstraints.SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(2);
    sasConstraints.Permissions = SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read | SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Write;
    ```

3. Replace `TODO 5` with the following:

    ```charp
    //TODO: 5. construct the full URI with SAS
    string sasBlobToken = blob.GetSharedAccessSignature(sasConstraints);
    return blob.Uri + sasBlobToken;
    ```

4. With the SAS URI to the upload photo in hand, scroll to `GetPhotoDemographics` to implement the call to the Face API.

    ![GetPhotoDemographics is high-lighted in Visual Studio.](./media/visual-studio-mainwindowxaml-getphotodemographics.png "GetPhotoDemographics method")

5. Replace `TODO 6` with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO 6. Invoke Face API with URI to photo
    IFaceServiceClient faceServiceClient = new FaceServiceClient(_faceApiKey, _faceEndpoint);
    ```

6. Replace `TODO 7` with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO 7. Configure the desired attributes Age and Gender
    IEnumerable<FaceAttributeType> desiredAttributes = new FaceAttributeType[] { FaceAttributeType.Age, FaceAttributeType.Gender };
    ```

7. Replace `TODO 8` with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO 8. Invoke the Face API Detect operation
    Face[] faces = await faceServiceClient.DetectAsync(sasUri, false, true, desiredAttributes);
    ```

8. Replace `TODO 9` with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO 9. Extract the age and gender from the Face API response
    double computedAge = faces[0].FaceAttributes.Age;
    string computedGender = faces[0].FaceAttributes.Gender;
    ```

9. Save the file.

### Task 4: Invoke pricing model

1. Within `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, scroll to the end of `UpdateDynamicPrice` and replace `TODO 10` with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO 10. Invoke the actual ML Model
    PricingModelService pricingModel = new PricingModelService();
    string gender = d.gender == "Female" ? "F" : "M";
    suggestedPrice = await pricingModel.GetSuggestedPrice((int)d.age, gender, _itemName);
    ```

2. Save the file.

### Task 5: Configure the Simulator

1. In the Simulator project, open `App.config`.

2. Within the `appSettings` section, set the following settings (there were copied into a text edit previously):

    * **faceAPIKey**: set this to the KEY 1 value for your Face API as acquired from the Azure Portal.

    * **faceEndpoint**: set this to the ENDPOINT value for your Face API as acquired from the Azure Portal (for example: <https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0>)

    * **storageConnectionString**: set this to the connection string of the Storage Account you created with the photos container.

        * On your Storage account blade. Select **Access Keys** from the left-hand menu.

            ![Screenshot of the Settings section on the Storage blade. Access keys is highlighted.](./media/azure-storage-account-access-keys.png "Storage blade, Settings section")

        * Use the copy button to the right of the Connection String for key1 to copy your storage connection string. Save the copied value to a text editor, such as Notepad, as this will be used later on.
